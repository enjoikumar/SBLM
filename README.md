# Home
The home page uses a jquery based slideshow, DOM manipulation, and every page is mobile responsive.
Upon refresh the home page will shuffle an image with a link to the work page where clicked on studio is highlighted.
For example, clicking on the civic link in the home page, will highlight the civic projects in the work page, and so forth.
The photos chosen are in black and white to intice the user to continously click through the page until getting to a final project folder and ultimately see full color images with the according narrative. 
The only color in the page are the studios which guide the user to click on the divs that will direct them further onto the site. 
If the highlighted divs aren't an indicator the nav bar is, which will direct users to the work and contact page.
